Things to do:

1) Finish API routes (endpoints)

2) Decide what client sends to server and what server sends to clients
  - Client needs to send sessionID on connection to server
  - Server needs to update Play/Pause for each client based on mySessionID
  - Clients send Play/pause requests to Server
  - Server checks to see the state of the video, and will send the
    correct play/pause command back to the clients

3) Implement #2

4) Figure out "Ready State"
  - On page 4, have text box and ready start
    - this sends URL to DB
  - Check to see if each client is on that stored URL and mark them ready/not Ready
  - "Load URL" button
